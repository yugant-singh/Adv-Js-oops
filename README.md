SECTION 1: Objects & OOPS Thinking
🔹 1. User Object Concept

A user generally contains:

Data: name, email

Behavior: login action

This demonstrates how objects combine information + functionality, making code grouped and meaningful.

🔹 2. Managing Multiple Users
➤ Without Using Classes

Each user must be created manually as a separate object.

Code becomes long, repetitive, and harder to maintain.

Behavior (methods) are duplicated for every user.

Not scalable when number of users increases.

➤ Using Classes

A class acts as a blueprint.

You can quickly create as many users as needed.

All users share the same method definitions.

Code becomes short, clean, and structured.

⚡ Why this matters:
Classes help organize code and reduce duplication, showing the true power of OOPS.

🔹 3. Product Object Concept

A product generally consists of:

Data: name, price

Behavior: ability to calculate discounted price

This demonstrates how objects can model real-world things and perform actions on their own data.

SECTION 2: Classes & Objects
🔹 4. Car Class

A Car class typically includes:

brand – identifies the car

speed – how fast the car goes

drive() – behavior that describes the car in motion

This section teaches how a class holds variables + methods describing a model.

🔹 5. Two Different Car Objects

Objects created from the same class hold different data, even though structure is same.

Helps understand instance-level data, i.e., each object stores its own values independently.

SECTION 3: Constructor & this Keyword
🔹 7. Student Class

The Student class demonstrates:

Constructor:
Executes automatically when a new object is created and assigns initial values (name, roll number).

this keyword:
Refers to the current object, allowing access to its own properties and methods.

introduce():
A behavior where the student object describes itself.

This section clarifies how data is set on objects and how this connects behavior to that data.
