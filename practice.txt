# SECTION 1: Objects and OOPS Thinking (Foundation)
	1.	Create a user object that stores name and email and has a login method which prints “User logged in”.
	2.	Imagine you now have 5 users.
First, think how you would manage them without using a class.
Then convert the same logic using a class and observe how the code becomes cleaner. Write code for both approaches.
	3.	Create a product object that stores name and price and has a method which returns the final price after discount.

The goal of this section is to understand why keeping data and behavior together makes code easier to manage.
====================================================

 # SECTION 2: Classes and Objects
	4.	Create a Car class with the following:
brand
speed
a drive method that prints the car brand and speed
	5.	Create two different car objects from the same class and verify that their data is different.
	================================================
